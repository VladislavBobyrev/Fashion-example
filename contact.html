            Even though we are currently under the shadow of Covid pandemic,
            fashion is still unstoppably progressing. It is the fifth year of
            Taipei Fashion Week, and the organizers have been expecting that
            fashion is able to have crossover collaborations with diverse
            cultures since year one, in order to have the fashion week in Taiwan
            with its exclusive cultural expression in the world.
          </p>
          <p class="about__text about__text--position-right">
            Taipei has been being surrounded by all sorts of fashion elements
            since October. You are able to see the key visual of SS23 < Meet>
            almost everywhere in Taipei, whether they are light boxes in metro
            stations, posters on streets, and flags hanging on street lights.
            The visual is two women wearing the garments designed by Yuma Taru
            and Justin Chou. Their design manifests dynamics of the beauty of
            indigenous crafts and modern fashion. The hidden history of culture
            in the visual indicates the encounter between Dutch people and
            Taiwan indigenous habitants. They learned the European cross-stitch
            from these Dutch people. Then they met Japanese during Japanese
            occupation era, and knew how to make headwear with kimono sense.
            Now, we are in the 21st century, these indigenous artisans
            inheriting the crafts from their ancestors, encounter fashion
            designers living in a modern city. Together, they create original
            works of Taiwan fashion. They prove that the process of fashion
            evolution is actually the result of cultural encounters time after
            time.
          </p>

          <p class="about__text about__text--accent">
            We are currently living in an unstable era, the boundary between the
            value of tradition and avant-garde becomes vague, and a new force is
            trying to set up a new order. SS23 Taipei Fashion Week utilizes
            clothes as a carrier, and indigenous culture as a foundation, in
            order to manifest the uniqueness of Taiwan contemporary aesthetics
            and make a remarkable and vivid memory for the next generation.

            Taipei Fashion Week launched a select shop last year during the
            event, and received a very positive response. TFW collaborates with
            Breeze Couture this season, and is going to launch an exclusive
            select shop again from 10/14 to 11/30. Breeze Couture is located on
            Daan Road, Taipei City, this road is regarded as a cradle of
            nurturing Taiwan fashion designers.
            <br />
            <br />
            Fashion pioneers such as Isabelle Wen and Jamei Chen both have a
            boutique store here. Many Taiwan design brands are going to be in
            the space of Breeze Couture this season. Breeze Group will assist
            designers to upload their works on E-commerce websites, and intend
            to have a contractual relationship with brands which are willing to
            be in Breeze Couture on a long-term basis after TFW, and introduce
            them to suitable overseas fashion buyers. By doing so, Breeze
            Couture truly achieves to have Taiwan fashion liaise with
            international market, and helps creators have more resources.
